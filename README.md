v1.0.0 - Initial Release

# Install
- Download from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7917) (recommended) or from the [latest release](/dmcrider/LastDayToPlant/releases/latest)
- Requires SMAPI
- Extract the ZIP to `\Stardew Valley\Mods\`
- Start the game to create the `config.json` file

# Configuration
For example, in addition to a notification on Day 16 of Spring for Cauliflower, if you enable all options, you will also get a notification on Days 18, 19, and 20 for Speed Gro, Deluxe Speed Gro, and Hyper Speed Gro, respectively, for Cauliflower.

The `config.json` file looks like this:

    {
      "IsAgriculturist": false,
      "ShowSpeedGro": false,
      "ShowDeluxeSpeedGro": false,
      "ShowHyperSpeedGro": false
    }

The `IsAgriculturist` flag will soon be removed by an automated check. When `true`, it accounts for the 10% growth rate boost given by that profession.
