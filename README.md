v1.0.0 - Initial Release

# Install
- Download from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7917) (recommended) or from the [latest release](/dmcrider/LastDayToPlant/releases/latest)
- Requires SMAPI
- Extract the ZIP to `\Stardew Valley\Mods\`
- Start the game to create the `config.json` file

# Configuration
Currently, there are four settings that can be toggled in the `config.json` file. They are:
- IsAgriculturist
- ShowSpeedGro
- ShowDeluxeSpeedGro
- ShowHyperSpeedGro

They are all false by default. Soon the `IsAgriculturist` flag will be determined automatically, but for now it is a flag.

If any of the others are set to `true`, then a new message will show on the appropriate day with a message that tells you which type of Speed Gro to use if you still want to harvest.

# Supported Languages
